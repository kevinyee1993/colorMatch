# Description
SnackTime is an original game created by me in which a player controls a character that can change into either a dog, cat, monkey, or rabbit.  The goal of this game is to catch falling food items with the correct animal.  If the player fails to catch the food before it hits the floor or if they catch certain foods with the wrong animal, then they lose a life.  Once they run out of lives, the game is over.
