General Design
*  Make player a line and not a square
*  Fall block movement is smooth and continuous right now, want to make it
   more choppy like tetris movement


*  Have score multiply with streaks
*  Increase lives if player gets a really big streak (50 in a row for example)
*  Power meter that goes up when you collect squares
    * press space to activate - for limited time player can grab any color square


as level increases:
* falling squares speed up as score goes up
* troll squares that miss a beat
* troll squares that alternate colors as they fall


IF WANT TO MAKE THE FALL BLOCKS FALL MORE SMOOTHLY
  * Change the fall increment to a smaller value
  * Increase the interval by a lot more
