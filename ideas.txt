TODO:

General Design
*  Have score multiply with streaks
*  Increase lives if player gets a really big streak (50 in a row for example)
*  Power meter that goes up when you collect squares
    * press space to activate - for limited time player can grab any color square


as level increases:
* falling squares speed up as score goes up
* troll squares that miss a beat
* troll squares that alternate colors as they fall


IF WANT TO MAKE THE FALL BLOCKS FALL MORE SMOOTHLY
  * Change the fall increment to a smaller value
  * Increase the interval by a lot more


NOTE:
looks like the blocks are only caught if the fall speed is even
for all three blocks if using 3, interval of 2 works

for blocks 1 and 3, interval of 2, 2.5, and 4 work

Might not need bone to touch all the way at the bottom, could just add some type of border
at the line where the bone touches and make that the endpoint
if you make the food touch all the way at the bottom it might look weird because it should disappear as soon as the animal eats it


FOR TOMORROW THURSDAY
write instructions on index rather than canvas
allow the users to either click or press a button to start the game
