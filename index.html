    <p>Instructions: Move your animal left and right by pressing the left/right arrow keys</p>
    <p>Protip: If you go past the screen you wrap around</p>
    <p>Switch animals py pressing A (dog), S (cat), D (monkey), or F (rabbit) </p>
    <p>Use the correct animal to eat their favorite food</p>

    <p>Everytime food falls to the ground or you catch the wrong food with
    the wrong animal (everyone knows dogs don't like to eat bananas!) You lose
    a life (hearts on the top left corner).  Once you lose three lives, it's game over!</p>

    you dont have to get it perfect you just have to get it done
